# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I am usually pretty accurate in my time estimates, but I occasionally underestimate the complexity of a task, causing it to take longer than estimated.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the course progressed, I gained a better understanding of the complexity of the tasks, which helped me improve my estimates. I started to better estimate how long it would take to write code and was able to allocate my time more appropriately.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

With these estimates, I was able to plan my time better and understand the importance of leaving enough time during development. This gave me more flexibility to deal with unexpected issues.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

From other people's code reviews, I learned different ways to solve problems. This also helped me come up with more possible solutions in the future problem-solving process.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

By reviewing other people's code, I improved my understanding of code readability and the importance of writing comments. I also learned how to give constructive feedback and help others improve their code.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 05 Feedback](https://github.com/HanyuXiao05/CP1404/pull/2)

### Explanation

This review provides a more efficient way to solve the same problemã€‚

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 07 Feedback](https://github.com/HanyuXiao05/CP1404/pull/3)

### Explanation

This review raises many issues regarding the program structure and provides suggestions for improvements.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge of this course, I would add some tasks about debugging and testing, because it is normal to encounter problems in the process of writing programs. At this time, if we master the skills of debugging and testing programs, it can help us solve the problems better.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

In the practicals of this course, I focused on the structure of the code. I took the time to understand the requirements of each task and ensure that my code not only worked, but was also easy to maintain and extend.
